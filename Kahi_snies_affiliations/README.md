# Kahi SNIES affiliations plugin

Kahi uses this plugin to insert or update institutional affiliations from raw SNIES institution records.

# Description

This plugin reads raw institution records from a MongoDB collection populated from the SNIES/HECAA `Instituciones.xlsx` file and maps them into CoLav's standard `affiliations` entity.

The matching order is:

1. Exact match by `CÓDIGO_INSTITUCIÓN` as `external_ids.source = snies`.
2. Text and fuzzy name match against `affiliations.names.name`, following the approach used by other affiliations plugins.
3. Insert a new affiliation when no existing document is found.

Only standard affiliation fields are written. Raw descriptive fields that do not belong in the normalized entity, such as `MISIÓN`, are ignored.

Current mapping:

- `NOMBRE_INSTITUCIÓN` -> `names`, formatted as Spanish title case with `lang: es`; acronym-like suffixes are moved to `abbreviations`.
- `CÓDIGO_INSTITUCIÓN` -> `external_ids` with `source: snies` and `provenance: snies`.
- `NÚM_IDENTIFIC_TRIBUTARIA_NIT` -> `external_ids` with `source: nit` and `provenance: snies`, removing punctuation and the verification digit.
- `SECTOR` -> `types`, translating `Oficial` to `public` and `Privado` to `private`.
- `ESTADO` -> `status`, replacing any previous ROR status with `active` or `inactive`.
- `DEPARTAMENTO_DOMICILIO` and `MUNICIPIO_DOMICILIO` -> `addresses.state` and `addresses.city` only when those fields are missing.
- `PÁGINA_WEB` -> `external_urls` with `source: site` and `provenance: snies`.
- Accreditation fields -> `ranking` with `provenance: snies` and `sources: accreditation_status`.
